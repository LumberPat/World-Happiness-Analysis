    "# World Happiness Report Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview  \n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze the determinants of happiness across countries using data from the **World Happiness Report**. By exploring and visualizing the data, we aim to identify which factors (e.g., GDP per capita, social support, health) have the most significant impact on happiness scores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will involve the following steps:  \n",
    "1. **Importing and understanding the dataset**: We will examine the structure and key features of the data to understand what we are working with.  \n",
    "2. **Data cleaning**: Missing or inconsistent values will be handled to ensure the data is ready for analysis.  \n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will use statistical methods and visualizations to identify relationships between variables.  \n",
    "4. **Insights and Conclusions**: Key findings will be summarized, focusing on the factors that drive happiness globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives  \n",
    "- Understand the factors influencing happiness scores across different countries.  \n",
    "- Visualize correlations between key metrics (e.g., GDP per capita, life expectancy) and happiness scores.  \n",
    "- Highlight actionable insights for stakeholders (e.g., policymakers) to improve happiness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Project?  \n",
    "Happiness is a multidimensional concept influenced by economic, social, and environmental factors. By understanding these relationships, we can gain valuable insights into improving quality of life globally. This project also serves as a demonstration of my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using R, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries  \n",
    "The following tools and libraries will be used for this project:  \n",
    "- **R**: Primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.  \n",
    "- **tidyverse**: A suite of R packages for data manipulation and visualization.  \n",
    "- **ggplot2**: For creating insightful and aesthetic visualizations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the analysis and uncover the factors that contribute to happiness around the world! 😊\n"

    "\n",
    "### Summary of the Data\n",
    "We performed an initial exploration of the dataset, which contains 2363 rows and 11 columns. The dataset includes data on various factors impacting quality of life, such as:\n",
    "- `Country name` (country name),\n",
    "- `year` (year),\n",
    "- `Life Ladder` (happiness level),\n",
    "- `Log GDP per capita` (log of GDP per capita),\n",
    "- `Social support` (social support),\n",
    "- `Healthy life expectancy at birth` (life expectancy at birth),\n",
    "- Other variables like generosity, corruption perceptions, and emotional indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings:\n",
    "- The dataset spans the years **2005 to 2023**.\n",
    "- Missing values are present in several columns:\n",
    "  - `Log GDP per capita`: 28 missing values,\n",
    "  - `Social support`: 13 missing values,\n",
    "  - `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: 63 missing values,\n",
    "  - `Freedom to make life choices`: 36 missing values,\n",
    "  - `Generosity`: 81 missing values,\n",
    "  - `Perceptions of corruption`: 125 missing values,\n",
    "  - `Positive affect`: 24 missing values,\n",
    "  - `Negative affect`: 16 missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions to Take\n",
    "To proceed with data analysis:\n",
    "1. Identify the exact rows and patterns of missing values.\n",
    "2. Decide how to handle missing data:\n",
    "   - Remove rows with missing values if they are minimal and non-critical.\n",
    "   - Use imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, or forward-fill) to fill in missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step will involve creating a summary of missing data and visualizing their distribution for better decision-making.\n"

    "### Interpretation of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Year:** The `year` variable has values ranging from 2005 to 2023, with a mean year of approximately 2015. This indicates that the dataset spans recent years with a focus on recent data points.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Life Ladder:** The `Life Ladder` variable shows a mean score of 5.48, with a range between 1.28 and 8.02, indicating the global life satisfaction or happiness scores across various countries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Log GDP per capita:** The `Log GDP per capita` variable has a mean of 9.40 and ranges from 5.53 to 11.68. This shows the economic prosperity across the countries, with some having significantly higher GDP per capita than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other variables:** Variables such as `Social support`, `Healthy life expectancy`, `Generosity`, and others are also analyzed. Each has its own distribution, and the values show significant variation in terms of social and economic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these results, we can now explore further relationships between these variables or proceed with more advanced statistical analysis. The next steps will focus on identifying correlations and visualizing the data.\n"

    "## Correlation Analysis Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting the correlation analysis, we can observe several interesting relationships between the variables in the dataset. Below is a summary of the key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strongest Correlations:\n",
    "- **Log.GDP.per.capita** and **Healthy.life.expectancy.at.birth** (correlation = 0.83): There is a strong positive correlation between the Gross Domestic Product per capita and life expectancy at birth. This suggests that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have a higher life expectancy at birth.\n",
    "- **Life.Ladder** and **Healthy.life.expectancy.at.birth** (correlation = 0.73): Life satisfaction (Life Ladder score) also shows a strong positive correlation with life expectancy, indicating that people in countries with higher life expectancy tend to report higher life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moderate Correlations:\n",
    "- **Life.Ladder** and **Social.support** (correlation = 0.72): Social support has a moderate positive correlation with life satisfaction. This indicates that individuals who feel more supported socially tend to report higher life satisfaction.\n",
    "- **Freedom.to.make.life.choices** and **Positive.affect** (correlation = 0.58): There is a moderate positive relationship between the freedom to make life choices and positive emotions. This suggests that greater freedom in decision-making correlates with higher positive emotional experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaker Correlations:\n",
    "- **Generosity**: This variable shows weak correlations with other variables, indicating that generosity does not have a strong direct relationship with other factors such as life satisfaction, GDP, or social support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Correlations:\n",
    "- **Perceptions.of.corruption** and **Life.Ladder** (correlation = -0.45): There is a negative correlation between corruption perceptions and life satisfaction. Countries with higher perceptions of corruption tend to have lower life satisfaction scores.\n",
    "- **Negative.affect** and **Social.support** (correlation = -0.46): A negative correlation between negative emotions and social support suggests that individuals who report higher negative affect tend to perceive lower levels of social support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "To further understand these relationships, visualizing the correlation matrix through a heatmap will help in identifying strong and weak correlations more intuitively. It could also be valuable to explore the implications of these correlations on life satisfaction, possibly using predictive modeling or identifying which factors contribute most to variations in life satisfaction across countries.\n"

    "## Model Results Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression model has been successfully fitted to predict life satisfaction (`Life.Ladder`) based on various factors. The model's **Multiple R-squared** value of 0.7787 indicates that approximately 77.87% of the variance in life satisfaction is explained by the predictors. The **Adjusted R-squared** value of 0.7778 suggests a robust fit, considering the number of variables included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Log.GDP.per.capita**: A positive relationship between GDP per capita and life satisfaction was observed, with a coefficient of 0.3876. This implies that increases in GDP per capita are associated with higher life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Social.support**: Social support is the strongest predictor of life satisfaction, with a coefficient of 1.8867, suggesting that increased social support significantly enhances life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Healthy.life.expectancy.at.birth**: Higher life expectancy at birth has a positive, albeit smaller, impact on life satisfaction (coefficient: 0.0281).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Freedom.to.make.life.choices**: The coefficient of 0.4481 indicates that greater freedom to make life choices improves life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generosity**: Generosity also shows a positive effect on life satisfaction, with a coefficient of 0.3160.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Perceptions.of.corruption**: A negative relationship is observed with a coefficient of -0.7071, meaning that higher perceptions of corruption decrease life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Positive.affect**: Positive emotions have a strong positive impact on life satisfaction (coefficient: 2.2356), making it one of the most significant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Negative.affect**: The effect of negative emotions is negligible, with a coefficient of -0.0159 and a high p-value (0.9225), indicating that it does not significantly affect life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The analysis highlights the importance of social support, positive emotions, and economic factors (GDP and life expectancy) as key contributors to life satisfaction. Perceptions of corruption have a notable negative effect. The model explains a substantial portion of the variation in life satisfaction, providing valuable insights for policy makers and researchers aiming to improve well-being across different regions.\n"

    "### Model Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we evaluated the assumptions of the linear regression model, specifically focusing on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normality of Residuals**: To check if the residuals are normally distributed, we visualized their distribution using a histogram and a Q-Q plot. The histogram provides an overview of the residuals' distribution, while the Q-Q plot allows us to visually inspect if the residuals align with a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Histogram of Residuals**: This plot shows the distribution of the residuals, which helps us assess if they follow a normal distribution. Ideally, the histogram should have a bell-shaped curve for normality.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Q-Q Plot of Residuals**: The Q-Q plot compares the quantiles of the residuals with those of a normal distribution. If the points lie along the reference line, this indicates that the residuals are approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Residuals)**: Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the residuals should remain constant across all levels of the predicted values. To evaluate this assumption, we created a scatter plot of the residuals against the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot**: This plot helps us determine if the variance of residuals remains constant. Ideally, the plot should show a random spread of points around the horizontal axis (no clear patterns), indicating that the residuals have constant variance (homoscedasticity).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Autocorrelation of Residuals**: Autocorrelation refers to the correlation of residuals across different observations. If residuals are autocorrelated, it suggests a potential issue with the model (e.g., missing variables). To assess autocorrelation, we used the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **ACF Plot of Residuals**: This plot shows the autocorrelation of residuals at various lags. Ideally, we expect no significant autocorrelation (i.e., no spikes in the plot), suggesting that the residuals are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis of these diagnostic plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the histogram and Q-Q plot indicate that the residuals are normally distributed, the model assumption of normality is satisfied.\n",
    "- If the residuals vs. predicted values plot shows no discernible pattern, it suggests that homoscedasticity holds (constant variance of residuals).\n",
    "- If the ACF plot reveals no significant autocorrelation, the residuals are independent.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Social support**: This predictor shows a strong positive relationship (2.0820) with life satisfaction. The p-value (p < 2e-16) indicates high statistical significance.\n",

    "3. **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: The positive coefficient (0.0306) indicates that higher life expectancy is associated with better life satisfaction. This relationship is highly significant (p < 2e-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Freedom to make life choices**: The positive coefficient (0.6624) suggests that greater freedom in making life choices improves life satisfaction, and the result is statistically significant (p = 1.48e-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generosity**: The positive relationship (0.2486) with life satisfaction is statistically significant (p = 0.000412), indicating that more generous societies tend to report higher life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Perceptions of corruption**: The negative coefficient (-0.7900) indicates that higher perceptions of corruption are associated with lower life satisfaction, and this result is highly significant (p < 2e-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Positive affect**: A strong positive relationship (2.1996) suggests that individuals who experience more positive emotions have higher life satisfaction. This result is also highly significant (p < 2e-16).\n",

    "### Model Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has a **Multiple R-squared** value of **0.8421**, indicating that approximately 84.21% of the variation in life satisfaction is explained by the predictors included in the model. The **Adjusted R-squared** value of **0.8415** adjusts for the number of predictors in the model, further confirming the model's good fit. The **F-statistic** (1490 on 7 and 1956 degrees of freedom) with a p-value < 2.2e-16 suggests that the model as a whole is highly significant.\n",

    "The analysis indicates that **GDP per capita**, **social support**, **healthy life expectancy**, **freedom to make life choices**, **generosity**, **perceptions of corruption**, and **positive affect** are significant predictors of life satisfaction. The model explains a large proportion of the variance in life satisfaction (approximately 84%), and all the predictors have a statistically significant relationship with the outcome variable.\n"

    "1. **Data Preprocessing** – Missing values were handled, and appropriate transformations were applied to the variables.\n",
    "2. **Linear Regression Model Construction** – A linear regression model was built using selected variables to estimate the influence of factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and corruption on happiness levels.\n",
    "3. **Diagnostic Analysis** – Diagnostic plots were created to assess model assumptions, such as normality of residuals and linearity.\n",
    "4. **Results Interpretation** – The results were interpreted, identifying the most significant variables influencing happiness and evaluating model quality using R-squared and p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings:\n",
    "The model shows that the most significant factors affecting happiness are GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy. Additionally, perceptions of corruption have a negative impact on happiness, while positive affect and freedom to make life choices positively influence happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Assessment:\n",
    "The project was successfully completed, and the built linear regression model provided valuable insights. The analysis met its objectives and can be used for further research or policy recommendations.\n"
